Generally, Using simple returns as a method for measuring the performance of a portfolio is not a good choice since it does not take the risk into consideration. 
Sharpe ration is a popular metric for assessing the performance of the portfolios which is calculated by the difference of returns and risk free return divided by the variance of returns.

Risk-free trade is the return possible without any risk. for instance bank interest rate or government bonds returns are without risk.
